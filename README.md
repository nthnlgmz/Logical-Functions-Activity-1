# Logical-Functions-Activity-1

<b>Logical function are used in spreadsheets to test whether a situation is true or false. Depending on the result of that test, you can then elect to do one thing or another. These decisions can be used to display information, perform different calculations, or to perform further tests.</b><br>

<b>Microsoft Excel provides 4 logical functions to work with the logical values. The functions are AND, OR, XOR and NOT. You use these functions when you want to carry out more than one comparison in your formula or test multiple conditions instead of just one.</b>
